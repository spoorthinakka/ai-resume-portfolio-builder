# === AI Resume & Portfolio Builder – Setup Instructions ===

## 📁 STEP 1: Create your project folder
Create a new folder for your project.  
You can name it for example:  
AI-Resume-Portfolio-Builder
Open this folder in your preferred code editor (like **VS Code**) or terminal.

---

## ⚙️ STEP 2: Install Python
Make sure **Python 3.8 or newer** is installed.  
Check your version:
python --version
If Python is not installed, download it from:  
👉 https://www.python.org/downloads/

---

## 🧠 STEP 3: Create the main app file
Inside your project folder, create a file named:
app.py
Paste the complete **AI Resume & Portfolio Builder** Streamlit code into this file.

---

## 🔑 STEP 4: Create your `.env` file
In the same folder as `app.py`, create a new file named:
.env
Add your API key inside it:
HF_TOKEN=your_api_key_here

💡 **Tip:** Keep your `.env` file private — never upload it to GitHub.

---

## 🧩 STEP 5: (Important) Create and Activate Virtual Environment
To isolate project dependencies, create a virtual environment.

**For Windows (PowerShell):**
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

If you face a security error like “UnauthorizedAccess”, run:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
Then activate again:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

**For macOS/Linux:**
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

💡 **Note:** Each time you reopen VS Code or PowerShell after closing it, your virtual environment will deactivate automatically.  
Simply reactivate it before running commands again using:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

---

## 📦 STEP 6: Install Required Dependencies
All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.  
Install them by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

This installs:
- streamlit — for the web interface  
- huggingface_hub — to connect with Hugging Face API  
- python-docx — for downloadable Word resumes  
- fpdf — for downloadable PDF resumes  
- python-dotenv — for secure API key loading

---

## 🚀 STEP 7: Launch the App
Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py
Your browser will open automatically, showing the **AI Resume & Portfolio Builder** interface.

---

## ✅ You’re all set!
You can now generate, edit, and download resumes — and even export your AI-generated **Portfolio Website (.zip)**.
